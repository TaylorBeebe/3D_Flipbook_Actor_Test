Unreal Engine four and eight directional flipbook components for use in 3D games (similar to
games like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler). Feel free to use this in your own project,
all that's needed is adding the component to your actor and setting the directory to the flipbook.
The component supports walking, running, and stationary animations and keeps a second flipbook
for aligning perpendicular to the directional light for shadow casting.

Flipbook Character is an example of using the component with a character.
